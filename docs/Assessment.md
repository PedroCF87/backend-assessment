## A day at a coffee shop!

A customer visits a coffee shop that sells a bunch of items (e.g. beverages, sandwiches etc.).

Items have varying tax rates and some are free or offered at a discount when ordered with another item.

The customer is made aware of the order total and once he pays for it, he can wait until notified of the order completion.

You are required to describe a program that with a set of interfaces that models the above problem at hand. 

You need to design the DB and backend architecture and implement it. 

Front-end is not mandatory but your endpoints should be reachable through Postman. 

User should be able to see the list of available items, User should be able to order them and user should get an notification after fixed amount of time that your order is ready.
